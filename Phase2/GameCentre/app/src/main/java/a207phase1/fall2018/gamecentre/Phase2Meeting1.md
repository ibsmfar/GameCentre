** Friday November 16th **

* The scoreboard and save functionality were addressed as areas that needed to
be improved/completed from phase 1
* Ibrahim took on that responsibility and planned to have it completed by the weekend
* We decided on the 2 additional games for Phase 2, those being: HANGMAN and 2048
* Ibrahim and Florin decided to work on 2048 together
* Elias and Dhruv decided to work on HANGMAN together
* We had trouble setting up the repo for Phase 2 so decided try to finish that up
later that night individually
* In the meantime we would work individually on our games and would push everything
once we got it working.
