** Friday November 16th **

* We continued to have errors setting up the repo this session 
* Florin found the following tutorial to assist in the making of 2048:
https://github.com/tpcstld/2048/tree/master/2048/2048/src/main/java/com/tpcstld/twozerogame
* This will be treated as a tutorial, where some code may be used and cited as required
* Elias found the following tutorial to assist in the making of HANGMANA:
https://github.com/sanchi4/Hangman-android-studio-project
* This will be treated as a skeleton for a hangman game, where some of the code
will be used and cited but most of it will be changed to fit our dessired specifications for the game
* Elias worked on the HANGMAN game and added the following features: display of used letters,
adding different complexity (MEDIUM AND HARD LEVELS)
* Elias completed those HANGMAN game tasks
* Since the repo was not working at that point all files that Elias was working on were sent to Dhruv
and Dhruv continued to work on HANGMAN based on those original files
