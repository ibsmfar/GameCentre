**Saturday October 27**

* First hour spent making sure everyone could access the file
* Second hour spent adding more detail in our CRC cards and dividing up the work between us
* Time was spend on additional research on topics which we were planning on using in our program which we hadn't covered yet in class (including buttons and timer)
* The majority of the remaining time was spent on individual work after we split up the work to be done
* Before the team meeting ended we spoke about what we accomplished during the team meeting, what we were planning to do for the rest of the week and if anyone had any additional questions
